# Design pattern decisions

- Talk about commit/reveal
- Contract simplicity and readability
- Reducing gas/storage costs (use Remix to test different storage structures)
- Emergency stop "circuit breaker"
- In terms of game incentives, I wrestled with the friction involved with having users (especially game creators) take multiple actions. The first iteration of the game's design was to have both players enter into the game and be locked in, then commit their move, then reveal. I realized since we're using encryption, the game creator can submit their move at the time they create the game, and reveal it after the opponent joined and committed their move. However, extending from that train of thought I realized that would mean the opponent's move didn't have to be encrypted since it's being submitted at the same time both players are locked into the game (auto-revealed, basically). This is a great experience for the challenger (1 MetaMask action), but a disincentivized experience for the game creator, who would not only have to create the game but also reveal their move within 24 hours of being challenged. So, I decided to keep the system of both creator and challenger having to commit and reveal to keep things "more fair". I went with this option instead of incentivizing game creators with a small portion of the prize if they lost--if you have opinions on this, please share them with me!
